                <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability
                    of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to
                    perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.</p>

                <p>Developers have always valued the ability to build their applications on integrated stacks of
                    foundational technology. By using a set of standardized building blocks, they can spend more time
                    working on applications that differentiate the business, rather than gluing lots of separate
                    components together .</p>

                    do? Well, you can copy and paste the information from Wikipedia to your own file. But what if you
                    want to get large amounts of information from a website as quickly as possible? Such as large
                    amounts of data from a website to train a Machine Learning algorithm? In such a situation, copying
                    and pasting will not work! And that’s when you’ll need to use Web Scraping.
